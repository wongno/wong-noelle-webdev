# **Noelle Wong Web Dev Summer 2 2017**
## **Information about Me**
I am a third year, undergraduate student at Northeastern. I am a combined Computer Science and Design major. I just finished my first co-op and have no experience in web development. I have tried to create my own portfolio website in the past, but had little success with creating one. I chose to take this course to find out whether web development is something I would like to further pursue.

## **The Purpose of this Repository**
The main purpose of this repository is to create my projects for the webdev course.
