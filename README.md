# **Noelle Wong Web Dev Summer 2 2017**
## **Information about Me**
I am a rising third year, undergraduate student at Northeastern. I am a combined Computer Science and Design major. I recently finished my first co-op and currently have no experience in web development. I have attempted to create my own portfolio website as a side project in the past, but had little success in creating one. I decided to enroll in this course in order to find out whether web development was a subject I would like to further pursue and possibly try out for co-op.
